I think the gonverment intervention impacts technology companies and their users by having transparacy and accountiablilty ,and in my humble opinion i think that companies like tiktok address sercuity concers while continuing to operate ,also if i was one developer in tiktok i would put in a implement in the app which would allow the user to have even more privicy like passwards and such. A lesson i can take from this and use it in this class is to use/work on privicy setteing.

AI tools have the potential to revolutionize the way students study and prepare for tests like the STAAR. With personalized learning experiences, AI can adapt to individual learning styles and paces, providing tailored resources that address specific weaknesses. For instance, an AI tutor could analyze a student's performance on practice tests and identify areas where they struggle, offering targeted exercises and explanations to reinforce those concepts. Additionally, features like interactive quizzes and instant feedback can keep students engaged and motivated, making the study process more efficient and effective. The ability to access these resources anytime and anywhere also means that students can study at their convenience, fitting their preparation into busy schedules.

Personally, the most useful feature of an AI tutor for me would be its ability to provide real-time assistance and clarification on complex topics. If I encounter a challenging math problem or a difficult reading passage, having an AI that can break down the concepts and offer step-by-step guidance would be invaluable. I would definitely consider using such a tool, as it could enhance my understanding and retention of the material. However, I would also need to ensure that I balance AI assistance with traditional study methods, as I believe that a combination of resources can lead to the best outcomes. Ultimately, the convenience and adaptability of AI tools make them an appealing option for test preparation, and I would be eager to explore their potential benefits.
