I think the gonverment intervention impacts technology companies and their users by having transparacy and accountiablilty ,and in my humble opinion i think that companies like tiktok address sercuity concers while continuing to operate ,also if i was one developer in tiktok i would put in a implement in the app which would allow the user to have even more privicy like passwards and such. A lesson i can take from this and use it in this class is to use/work on privicy setteing.

For some reason I found it very interesting how easy it is to calculate a solvent's saturation. I always thought chemistry was very hard i now know it isint. Intrsing enough i did not learn this in my chem class i learned it on tick tok.
